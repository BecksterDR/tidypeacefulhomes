        <li><strong>Consultation Required:</strong> All new clients must complete a phone or virtual consultation and send photos of the work area(s) prior to scheduling In-Home Services</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Sessions must be booked at least 24 hours in advance with a start/end time within our working hours of 8am to 8pm. Sessions scheduled less than 24 hours in advance are subject
            to a $50 convenience fee. Sessions with start or end times outside the working hours

            final session. If a cancellation or reschedule fee applies, it will be deducted from your deposit, and any remaining balance will still go toward your final session. If the deposit is used up with fees 
            before the final session, another deposit will be required before the final session.
