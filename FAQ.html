                        <span class="arrow">></span> How are you different from other oganizing services? Why should I trust you in my home?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"> I understand how vulnerable this process can be, and I take that trust very seriously. 
                        Your space and your story are always treated with respect and confidentiality. 
                        <br>
                        <br>My goal isn’t just to tidy your space, it’s to help you feel at peace in your home again. I’m not here to sell you containers or 
                        just put things in pretty bins. 
                        <br>
                        <br>I focus on the connection between your mental health and your physical space, because they’re deeply linked.
                        I’ve spent years studying mental wellness, reading books, and applying those principles in my own home.
                        <br> 
                        <br>What I offer isn’t just organization, it’s 
                        transformation that’s sustainable, personal, and rooted in compassion. I know this works because I live it too.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">Compassion and empathy are the core values of Tidy Peaceful Homes. Everyone’s life gets busy and sometimes clutter creeps up on us.
                        <br>
                        <br> You reached out for support, and that takes strength, not shame.
                        <br>
                        <br>It's very unlikely that your home is "too messy". No matter how overwhelmed things may feel, you are not too far gone. I’m here to help, not judge. 
                        <br>
                        <br>However, though I have the utmost respect and empathy for your situation, I’m not trained to work in cases of severe hoarding. If that’s your situation,
                         I’d recommend connecting with a specialist 
                        who can better support your needs.

                    <p class="answer">Never. Not one single item will be put in a trash bag without me confirming with you if it is trash. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Every decision is yours to make; I guide and support, you stay in control.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">            
                        It starts with a virtual consultation where I will assess the situation, determine your goals, and give my best honest estimate on how many sessions you need 
                        (the length of which depends on how quickly you make decisions, if you want to declutter, how hands-on you want to be, and the size of the space). 
                        <br>
                        <br>Then, I'll send you a link to book your session(s).
                         I will travel to your home at your booked date and time to work with you in your space. With your permission, I will take before and after photos to document the process.
                         <br>
                        <br> From here, it depends on how involved you want to be:
                           <br>     
                    <br><strong><i>Hands On:</i></strong> We go through each item together to decide if it’s a toss, keep, or donate, and then find a home for it. You decide the 
                    pace, how many decluttering and organizing tips you want during the session, and how much you want me to gently push you to declutter.
                   <br>
                    <br><strong><i>Less Hands On:</i></strong> I’ll sort items into categories before we declutter so decision-making feels less overwhelming and more bite-sized. 
                    After you decide which items are keep, toss, or dontate, we can organize together or you can give me guidelines to follow.
                     <br>   
                    <br><strong><i>Hands Off:</i></strong> You set the vision for the space, tossing and decluttering limits, and a general idea of where you want item types to live and I take care of the rest.
                    <br><i>(Hands-off is not recommended; it's less effective for long-term results and less cost efficient for you. Additionally, I don't know your space
                         and habits as well as you do so I may not put things in the most functional place for you)</i>
                        <br>
                    <br>In order to not leave you with clutter to organize after I leave, I'll start winding down the session 15-30 minutes before the end time to allow us 
                    to finish up and put everything away. 
                    <br>
                    <br>I will load up any trash or donation items generated during the session and take them with me (up to one car-load).
                    <br> 
                    <br>Payment for the session and any add-on services is due before I leave the property. If desired, you may book additional sessions at that time.
