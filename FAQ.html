                    <p class="answer"> My goal isn’t just to tidy your space, it’s to help you feel at peace in your home again. I’m not here to sell you containers or 
                        just put things in pretty bins. I focus on the connection between your mental health and your physical space, because they’re deeply linked.
                        I’ve spent years studying mental wellness, reading books, and applying those principles in my own home. What I offer isn’t just organization, it’s 
                        transformation that’s sustainable, personal, and rooted in compassion. I know this works because I live it too

                    <p class="answer">I understand how vulnerable this process can be, and I take that trust very seriously.

                    <p class="answer">Not at all! Everyone’s life gets busy. You reached out for support, and that takes strength, not shame</p>

                        However, I’m not trained to work in cases of severe hoarding, so if that’s the situation, I’d recommend connecting with a specialist

                        After an intial consultation to determine how to best use our time together, I travel to your home to work with you in your space.
                        I begin by sorting your belongings into simple, easy-to-understand categories so you can clearly see what you have.
                        Then I guide you through deciding what to keep, toss, or donate, always respecting your pace and your choices. 
                        Finally, I organize your space using what you already have and, if necessary, help you bring in new solutions that fit your style, needs, and budget

                    pace, how many decluttering and organizing tips you want during the session, and how much you want me to gently push you to declutter
                   
                    <br><strong><i>Less Hands On:</i></strong> I’ll sort items into categories before we declutter so decision-making feels less overwhelming and more bite-sized. 
                    We can then organize together or you can give me guidelines to follow
                        
                    <br><strong><i>Hands Off <span style="font-weight:normal;">(not recommended, less effective for long-term results)</span>:</i></strong> You set the vision for

                    <p class="answer">No, I am not trained to work in cases of severe hoarding. If that’s your situation, I’d recommend connecting with a specialist who can better
